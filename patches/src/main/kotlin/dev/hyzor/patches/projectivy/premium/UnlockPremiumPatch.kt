/**
 * Projectivy keeps the free/paid decision in one place: a `StateFlow<Boolean>` created by
 * `PTApplication`'s constructor.
 *
 * ### Which way the flag points
 *
 * `true` means **not registered**. The Premium page (`pj3`) reads it and shows the
 * "register" text and purchase animation only while it is `true`; the parental-control,
 * custom-background and theme-import screens send the user to `PremiumActivity` when it is
 * `true` and let the action through when it is `false`. Roughly thirty UI classes read the
 * same flow directly (display profiles, settings rows and Compose screens), which is why
 * forcing the one flow covers the whole app rather than one screen.
 *
 * ### How it is written
 *
 * The constructor seeds the flow with `Boolean.TRUE` and publishes it through an
 * `asStateFlow()` wrapper. After that, the only writer is `PTApplication.d(Z)V`, which sets
 * it to `z && (lastStart <= 0 || now - lastStart > 8 days)`. That writer is called with
 * `!purchased` from the Play Billing collector, and with `true` from the startup path, so
 * leaving it in place would restore the lock a moment after the patched seed.
 *
 * The patch therefore does the two things the 4.71 upstream patch did, adapted to the new
 * shape:
 *
 *   1. the constructor's `Boolean.TRUE` seed becomes `Boolean.FALSE`;
 *   2. `d(Z)V` starts with `return-void`, so nothing can flip the flow back.
 *
 * There is no second copy of the decision: `x` is the mutable flow, `y` is its read-only
 * wrapper, and no other code writes `x`.
 *
 * The app's native `PTUtils` signature check (`PTApplication.f()`) is left alone. On a
 * re-signed build it only feeds a device-id fallback in the startup analytics; it does not
 * gate premium, and the 4.71 patch did not touch it either.
 *
 * Only client-side decisions change. Anything Projectivy's backend or Play Billing reports
 * is untouched.
